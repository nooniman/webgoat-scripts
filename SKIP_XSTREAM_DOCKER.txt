XSTREAM LESSON - DOCKER REQUIREMENT ISSUE
====================================================================

SITUATION:
----------
✅ You don't want to install Docker
❌ XStream CVE-2013-7285 lesson REQUIRES Docker WebGoat
❌ Network error when trying to access the endpoint

EXPLANATION:
------------
The XStream lesson specifically states:
"This lesson only works when you are using the Docker image of WebGoat."

Your WebGoat instance (192.168.254.112:8001) is likely NOT running
in Docker, so this endpoint doesn't exist or isn't accessible.

====================================================================
SOLUTION: SKIP THIS LESSON
====================================================================

✅ Recommended: Skip this lesson and move to others

You have MANY other lessons available that don't need Docker:
- SQL Injection (more variants)
- Authentication Bypass
- JWT attacks
- SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
- Insecure Deserialization (other types)
- Access Control
- Cryptography lessons

====================================================================
WHAT YOU CAN DO:
====================================================================

OPTION 1: Use the Lesson Finder
--------------------------------
Open: c:\webgoat-scripts-1\webgoat_lesson_finder.html

This tool will:
- Show all available lessons in your WebGoat
- Test if XStream endpoint exists
- Help you find what you CAN complete

OPTION 2: Read and Understand Conceptually
-------------------------------------------
You already have the knowledge:
- Read: xstream_cve_guide.txt
- Understand: How XStream deserialization works
- Know: The exploit technique (proxy + handler + exec)

This is valuable even without completing the lesson!

OPTION 3: Move to Next Lesson
------------------------------
Tell me what lesson you want to do next, and I'll help you!

Popular choices:
- JWT (JSON Web Token) attacks
- SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
- Insecure Deserialization
- Authentication Bypass
- Access Control flaws

====================================================================
QUICK TEST: Is Your WebGoat Docker-based?
====================================================================

Run this in browser console:

fetch('http://192.168.254.112:8001/WebGoat/actuator/health')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(e => console.log('Not available'));

If it returns health info, you might have more endpoints available.

====================================================================
BOTTOM LINE:
====================================================================

Don't waste time on a lesson that requires Docker if you don't have it.

✅ You've learned the CONCEPT (that's what matters!)
✅ You have guides for reference
✅ Move on to lessons you CAN complete
✅ Come back to this if you ever use Docker WebGoat

What lesson would you like to tackle next? 🚀
